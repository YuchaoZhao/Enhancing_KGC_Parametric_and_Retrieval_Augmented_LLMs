# Enhancing Knowledge Graph Construction: Ensembling Parametric and Retrieval-Augmented LLMs


## Abstract:
Recentlylargelanguagemodels(LLMs)havedevelopedrapidly and shown good question-and-answer capabilities, and their potential use for knowledge graph construction has been investigated by various researchers, but currently, even advanced LLMs still have their limita- tions when constructing knowledge graphs and shows weakness in cer- tain knowledge domains. This paper investigated how parametric models and retrieval-augmented models can be ensembled to better accomplish knowledge graph construction. The work ensembled LLMs according to three different features individually and test them with KAMEL, the benchmark database used for knowledge base construction (KBC). In addition, this work also used multiple features with machine learning techniques to create guide labels in the benchmark dataset to ensemble LLMs for knowledge graph construction. It was found that the ensem- bling of different essential features individually significantly improved the performance of LLMs for knowledge graph construction. While multiple features can be utilized to ensemble LLMs for knowledge graph con- struction, it is not guaranteed that their use will yield superior results compared to ensembling with a single feature.
